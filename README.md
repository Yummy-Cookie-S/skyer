Skyer is a high version of the Minecraft Air Island plugin, dedicated to better scalability and performance. It supports the use of a database for data storage and management, and uses the [Advanced-Slime-World-Manager](https://github.com/Paul19988/Advanced-Slime-World-Manager) for better world management efficiency. Uses the powerful cross-platform library [TabooLib](https://github.com/TabooLib/taboolib).
